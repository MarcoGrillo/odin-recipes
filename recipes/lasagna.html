  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>The world's best lasagna recipe combines rich, layered flavors that harmonize perfectly in every bite. The dish
    starts with a hearty, slow-cooked meat sauce made from ground beef, Italian sausage, and finely chopped onions,
    simmered in a rich tomato base with garlic, fresh basil, and a splash of red wine for depth. As the sauce cooks, the
    flavors meld together, creating a deeply savory foundation. The pasta layers, perfectly al dente lasagna sheets, are
    alternated with creamy ricotta cheese mixed with Parmesan, fresh parsley, and eggs, adding a smooth, velvety texture
    that complements the robust meat sauce.
  </p>
  <p>
    Each layer of the lasagna is generously sprinkled with a blend of mozzarella and Parmesan, which melts into a
    bubbly, golden-brown crust on top as it bakes. The secret to the perfect lasagna lies in letting it rest after
    baking, allowing the layers to set and the flavors to fully develop. The result is a hearty, comforting dish with
    the perfect balance of creamy, cheesy, and savory notes, making it the ultimate lasagna experience for any food
    lover.

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Prepare the Meat Sauce:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>In a large pan, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add chopped onions and cook until soft, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the ground beef and Italian sausage, breaking them apart as they cook. Cook until browned, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in minced garlic and cook for another minute until fragrant.</li>
        <li>Add crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce, red wine (optional), sugar, dried basil, oregano, red pepper flakes (optional), and salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>Reduce the heat to low, cover, and let the sauce simmer for at least 30 minutes (up to 1 hour), stirring occasionally.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    
    <li><strong>Prepare the Cheese Mixture:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>In a bowl, combine ricotta cheese, egg, Parmesan, fresh parsley, salt, and black pepper. Stir until smooth and well mixed.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    
    <li><strong>Cook the Lasagna Noodles:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the lasagna noodles and cook until al dente, following the package instructions.</li>
        <li>Drain the noodles and lay them flat on a sheet of parchment paper to prevent sticking.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    
    <li><strong>Assemble the Lasagna:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).</li>
        <li>Spread a thin layer of meat sauce at the bottom of a large baking dish.</li>
        <li>Place a layer of lasagna noodles on top of the sauce.</li>
        <li>Spread a layer of the ricotta mixture over the noodles.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle a layer of shredded mozzarella over the ricotta.</li>
        <li>Add another layer of meat sauce and repeat the process (noodles, ricotta, mozzarella, sauce) until you run out of ingredients, ending with a layer of meat sauce and mozzarella on top.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    
    <li><strong>Bake the Lasagna:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Cover the lasagna with foil (to prevent sticking, you can lightly oil the foil or use non-stick foil).</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove the foil and bake for an additional 20–25 minutes, or until the cheese on top is melted and golden brown.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    
    <li><strong>Let it Rest & Serve:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Remove the lasagna from the oven and let it rest for 10–15 minutes before serving. This allows the layers to set.</li>
        <li>Garnish with fresh parsley or basil if desired, and enjoy!</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
